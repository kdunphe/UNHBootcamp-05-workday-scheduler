**Homework Assignment #5**

Create a work day scheduler powered by jQuery code with a clean, easy to read to design.

**The work day scheduler includes:**
* Utilizes moment.js to capture the local time & date.
* Highlights the current time/schedule and shows past & present.
* A clean, responsive design.
* Follows semantic HTML5.
* Several resources linked to help with writing the jQuery.
* Note: still trying to figure out local storage. Will update later.
